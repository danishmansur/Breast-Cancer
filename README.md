# Breast-Cancer

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women after skin cancer. Mammograms can detect breast cancer early, possibly before it has spread. In this project I am using Machine Learning Model(SVM) to detect Breast cancer different 30 features. First we visualize the data  by plotting pairplots, histograms, scatterplots, correlation plots. After plotting different graphical methods, I implement SVC machine learning model and then evaluate its performance.
